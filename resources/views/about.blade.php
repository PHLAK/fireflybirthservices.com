        <h1>About Sarah</h1>

        <p>Sarah is a wife and mother of 2 children. She breastfed her first child
        until she self weaned due to bottle flow preference at six months old and
        went on to pump for her until she was a year old. With her son she delved
        into research, determined to do better for him and found herself in a
        lactation education class through Southwest Perinatology. Through this
        class she became a certified lactation educator and a member of CALCA in
        2012. She is actively working towards her international board certification
        for lactation consultants. Sarah has worked in both post partum L&amp;D
        units and NICU floors in two different hospitals in the valley. Through her
        years of working closely with moms and babies she became intrigued by birth
        and helping moms achieve their goals in this area as well. In 2016 she
        became a trained doula through Birth Trust doula training program. Shortly
        thereafter she was accepted as a midwifery student at the Birth Haven. She
        is now providing services as a doula, lactation educator, and placenta
        encapsulator all with a clear focus of helping moms achieve their personal
        goals in birth and beyond.</p>
