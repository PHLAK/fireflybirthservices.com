        <h1>Placenta Encapsulation</h1>

        <p>Mothers who choose to encapsulate their placentas report increased
        energy, easier time with hormone related inconveniences post birth, less
        postpartum depression in moms with a history in past pregnancies, and
        increased amount of breastmilk with a quicker turnover from colostrum to
        regular breast milk. The placenta not only holds high amounts of iron to
        replenish the body post birth it also holds the same hormone balance you
        had at birth for 4-5 days before starting to break down. This helps moms
        gently decrease their hormone levels instead of having a hormone "crash"
        3-5 days post birth. I practice 2 different forms of placenta
        encapsulation, chinese and raw. Each have their own risks and benefits
        which I will be happy to discuss with you.</p>
