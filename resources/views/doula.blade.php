        <h1>Doula Services</h1>

        <p>As a birth doula, I accompany women in labor to help them stay strong
        and calm during their birth. I will offer comfort measures,coping
        techniques,and constant presence to help you create a satisfying birth
        experience. I want to get to know you and your birth companion(s)
        prenatally, and will continuously support you and your loved ones during
        the birth of your baby. I will work to provide comfort and perspective
        to you and your partner, make suggestions as issues arise, and assist
        with messaging, positioning, and relaxation techniques as required. I
        draw on my professional training, knowledge and experiences to provide
        physical, emotional, and information support to women and  their
        partners. I am independent and self-employed. As your doula, I am
        working for you, not your caregiver or the facility where you birth.

        <h3>As a doula, I do not:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Perform clinical tasks, such as blood pressure, fetal heart
            checks, vaginal exams, etc. I am there to provide only physical
            comfort and emotional support.</li>

            <li>Make decisions for you. I will help you get the information
            necessary to make an informed decision. I will also remind you if
            there is a departure from your Birth Plan.</li>

            <li>Speak to the staff on your behalf regarding matters where health
            care decisions are being made. I will discuss your concerns with you
            and suggest options, but you or your partner will speak directly to
            the clinical staff.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Free consultation</h3>
        <p>It is very important that you and your partner are comfortable with
        me and with my role in the birth. Thus, I do expect to meet with clients
        at least once before labor to become acquainted, to explore and discuss
        your priorities and any fears or concerns, and to plan how we might best
        work together. At that time, we can discuss fees. This initial meeting
        is free and does not obligate you to use my services. If you choose to
        select me as your doula, I will want to become more familiar with your
        plans for labor, birth, and postpartum.</p>
